I am using a StringBuilder because it's memory friendly.
I want the user to select their province from a menu.
I want the user to fill in their personal details (name, surname, id/ passport).
The number late will be generated randomly using 3 alphabet charactors and numbers.
The user will then be provided with their details and Plate number.
